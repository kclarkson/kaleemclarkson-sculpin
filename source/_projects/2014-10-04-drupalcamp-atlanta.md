Returning for another year of theming I continuted with a similar design as the year before. This year I decided to use the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/radix">Radix</a> theme as it comes baked with SASS Bootstrap and works well with Panels. The idea is was to stay with a Flat UI design while using some newer CSS technologies such as Flexbox.
