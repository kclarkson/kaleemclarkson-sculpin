Belton Construction installs hurricane impact windows in Floriday. For this client we decided on redeveloping their brand through a newly designed logo and clear message.  Our goal was to create a simple site that highlighted the type of work they did along while also creating a sales funnel by making the contact form easily acessible on every page. For this project I decided on using the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/radix">Radix</a> base theme as it comes baked with SASS Bootstrap and works well with Panels.
