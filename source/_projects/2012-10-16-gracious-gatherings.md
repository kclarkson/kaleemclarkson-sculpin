Gracious Gatherings was my first catering site. My goal for this site was to incorporate their company colors of purple and olive green while keeping the site warm and welcoming. From a design perspective I decided to change their logo at little bit to resemble a cooking plate. Due to the variations of menu requests obtaining quotes for perspective clients are crucial in the catering business so I decided to design a simple request quote button on the left hand side of the page. This redirects users to a simple form which is then forwarded by email directly to the owners.
