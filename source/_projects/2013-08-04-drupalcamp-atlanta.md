Drupalcamp Atlanta in its 5th year with over 400 attendees is the largest Drupal Conference in the Southeast. This year's keynote speaker was Atlanta entrepreneur David Cummings, over 35 breakout sessions, and multiple tracks of programming. As you can imagine I was excited to be a part of the web development team for a conference that I love to attend. The actual Photoshop design was created by Sol Design Co but I was responsible for "theming" the page. Theming is when you take a mockup design and code it for the web. For this project I used SASS and Compass to help compile my CSS (Thanks Kendall !! ). I also did some advanced site building to develop the homepage slideshow, schedule, participants, and the random header image.
