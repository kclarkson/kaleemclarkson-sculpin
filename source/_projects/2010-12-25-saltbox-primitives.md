Design Concept
This being my first fully customized design, my goal was to drive home the companies worn and authentic look so I went with the paper design with burned edges look, with the light stars to match with the stores logos. The main navigation is a mix between a ribbon web2.0 buttons keeping it fun with the font and outside shade.

What made me the most happy is that our website has an artistic feel and doesn't look like a template or any other sites in the industry.
