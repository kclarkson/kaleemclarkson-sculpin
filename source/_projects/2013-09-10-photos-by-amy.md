Photos by Amy is my first photography portfolio website. Of course my main objective was to focus on Amy's photos but I wanted develop something that was responsive so her site looked good on a mobile phone. I used the Juicebox HTM5 image gallery plugin to showcase her different photos which really makes her page look great on mobile devices. Her company colors are pink and grey so to keep her site looking vibrant and clean I used a lot of white space for the pictures to really pop.
