Riverside Disposal and Recycling provides Central Maine curbside rubbish / trash removal, dumpster and rolloff rentals, recycling and compost, special pick-ups for both commercial and residential customers. They are a family owned and operated waste removal and recycling company that prides itself on being local, being green, and providing the very best service to their customers.

Design Concept 
The idea behind this design was create page that focused on their new business slogan of "red is the new green", by making red their major accents. I also tried to keep the design basic and clean as customers in Maine are very conscious about the environment. I also wanted to use a photo of a local "river" seeming the name is Riverside.

Features 
Pickup Schedules by City : 

They wanted to have pickup schedules for each city along with other news so I used panels along with some custom PHP for a block that shows the current days city.
